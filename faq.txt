Q: Isn't this another stupid hack with no purpose
A: This is a cool hack that adds utility over other file system hacks. Its
an anonymous, persistent shared filesystem. Once something is uploaded,
only the database admin can delete it. Everyone can read it. No one can
know who created it.

Q: Aren't you picking on TinyURL?
A: Not really. Out of the box, TinyDisk is not configured by default to even
use TinyURL. Out of the box, you cannot upload files larger than 2 megs. I
am actively distributing a alternative system so people can play with
TinyDisk *without* polluting TinyURL's database.

Q: This damn thing doesn't work! #@%& You!
A: Did you just download it and run it? RTFM! It is configured about of the
box to use an instance of Nanourl running on localhost. Edit the config file
TinyDisk.config and select the TinyURL stuff.

Q: This damn thing doesn't work on large files! #@%& You!
A: Did you not read the manual? Man I wish I could punch you in the face over
TCP/IP! Change the config file's MaxSize line. By default the limit is 2 megs.
